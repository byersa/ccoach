            The <b>Contract Coach (CC)</b> app project has two purposes. One is to <i style="color:blue;">create
            an online application</i> that will allow real estate agents to create offer contracts and to manage the
            receipt and comparison of contracts. The other purpose is to <i style="color:blue;">demonstrate the
            viability of the Dojobiz framework</i> in developing real world applications. The goal is to develop the
            first module, the <i style="color:red;">Contact module</i>, <i style="color:red;">within two
            months</i> and demonstrate it to those responsible for making the decision to open source it or not.
